# Sea Level Predictor 🌊

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification**.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze global sea level rise data since 1880 and predict future sea level change through the year 2050. Using Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy, we visualize trends and calculate lines of best fit for both the full dataset and recent years (2000 onward).

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the **US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**, containing:
- Year
- CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level
- Lower Error Bound
- Upper Error Bound
- NOAA Adjusted Sea Level

The file is named: `epa-sea-level.csv`.

## Visualizations
1. **Scatter Plot** – Shows the measured sea level changes by year.
2. **Line of Best Fit (1880 - 2050)** – Predicts future sea level rise based on the entire dataset.
3. **Line of Best Fit (2000 - 2050)** – Predicts future sea level rise based on recent trends.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install dependencies if needed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
